<h1>About “wherever SIM“</h1>

<strong>“wherever SIM"</strong> is a SIM card especially designed for Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) projects. It will drastically improve your mobile connectivity, since it is independent from the network operators.

<em>Top 5 features of this SIM card:</em>
<ul>
<li>multi network SIM card - global coverage without network preference</li>
<li>bidirectional communication thanks to static private IP addresses and VPN tunnel for increased security</li>
<li>REST API and web portal to configure and monitor your SIM cards including data limits</li>
<li>REST API to easily send and receive SMS from your device (e.g. to trigger emergency notifications from the device or send configurations to the device)</li>
<li>further security features: firewall and International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI) lock (lock SIM card to a specific device)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mission</h2>

Our current mission is to enable developers to realize innovation in the field of IoT. That's why we want to share our knowledge about M2M communication, IoT and the fields of application of multi network SIM cards in this context. With the help of new feature as REST API for SIM cards, we can all create so many new ideas together and be able to easily collect data for our projects.
